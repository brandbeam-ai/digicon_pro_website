AI-powered Branding & Social Commerce for Beauty Brand entering New Market

**HERO HEADLINE**

Stop Paying Booking Fees To Skeptical Influencers. Build Trust Signals First.

**HERO BODY COPY**

We deploy our intelligence engines technology to create up to 50 high-quality videos per month that make you LOOK like a brand worth betting on, then mine proof of customer demand from real engagement, so you can approach KOCs with leverage and good commission deals instead of hope.

**KEY METRICS / STATS SECTION**

70M \- REVENUE IMPACT (Attributed via optimization)

6B+ \- ORGANIC VIEWS (Across social media)

10M+ \- AD SPEND MANAGED (Optimized by our team)

375 \- CAMPAIGNS (Successful launches)

**FIT FILTER SECTION (Is this about me?)**

This Is For You If:

• Quality KOCs ignore your DMs or quote booking fees that would eat your entirely monthly budget

• You’ve spent tens of thousands on influencers and social media, but cannot point to single repeatable pattern that drive results

• You sense that Vietnamese consumers are changing fast but you do not know how to respond to them

• You’ve had viral moments that felt like luck but you can’t replicate them

• You’re entering or expanding in US and Vietnam/SEA with a real product, real e-commerce site, and need to learn what works fast

Not For You If:

• You want a few videos with no testing, no irritation, no learning loop

• You’re happy with one-time campaigns and do not need a sustainable playbook

• You expect guaranteed revenue from day one without needing a scaling system

• You’re domestic-only and offline-first with no interest in international expansion

• You want to hide the fact that AI was used (we believe in transparent "Tech-Beauty" positioning)

**THE FRAME (Why should I change?)**

The $2.7B Vietnam Market You Can See But Can’t Enter

You know the opportunity in Vietnam’s $2.74B and growing beauty market is real, but between you and that market is a wall called trust.

**Influencer Inflation Trap**

Mega-influencers now can cost $20k+ (20-40x increase since 2022\) with untrackable ROI. Your budget buys less reach each quarter.

**The Trust Collapse**

Vietnamese consumers now assume “unproven \= potential scam” due to the rise of counterfeit creams and deepfakes. Views no longer equal consideration.

**KOCs Rejection Loop**

Quality KOCs who actually drive sales will not risk their reputation on unknown brands. They either ghost you, demand prohibitive booking fees or give you their B-tier effort.

**The 2026 Cliff**

Vietnam’s new Advertising Law (Jan 2026\) makes KOCs personally liable for product claims. KOCs who were already cautious will become extremely selective.

**Zero Leverage**

You’re renting attention instead of building. Each campaign starts from zero. No compounding learning, no leverage for the next negotiation.

**THE MECHANISM (How can I change?)**

**How to Break the Rejection Cycle**

KOCs won’t work with you because you look unproven, and you can’t prove demand because KOCs won’t work with you.

\[TABLE\] **What you need | How we deliver it**

A “big brand energy” at 10% of the cost | High-quality AI product visualization makes you LOOK like a brand that has already invested millions

Direct buying signals | 30-50 videos per month that harvest intent comments which show PROOF of demand that you take to KOCs

The leverage to negotiate | The proof “500 people are already asking to buy” you receive from us changes the conversation from begging to offering

2026 compliance handled | Compliance documentation that satisfies KOC legal requirements

AI opens the door. KOCs close the sale.

**THE PROTOCOL \- HOW IT WORKS** 

3 Months From Being Unknown to Trustworthy

PHASE 1: THE TRUST BASE (Month 1\)

*Look like a brand worth partnering with*

We produce 10 high-end AI product-focused visualization videos that signal investment, quality control, and premium positioning. We also set up verified official accounts (Zalo OA, TikTok) for credibility.

Outcome: You pass the “first impression” test that currently fails.

PHASE 2: SIGNAL MINING (Months 1-2)

*Harvest proof of demand.*

We deploy 30-50 Al-generated shorts per month using trending audio and localized hooks – not to have vanity views, but to mine and categorize buying-signal data from comments. 

Outcome: You have documented evidence that real people want to buy.

PHASE 3: THE DATA-DRIVEN PITCH (Month 3\)

*Change the negotiation.*

Now you approach KOCs with a different script: "We have 500 people asking where to buy. You take the commission." You're offering them a deal instead of begging them to take the risk.

Outcome: Commission-only partnerships. No booking fees. Aligned incentives.

PHASE 4: VERIFICATION & CONVERSION (Month 3\)

*Make it real.*

Al opened the door, KOCs closed the sale. They post "real skin" reviews that validate what the earlier high-quality videos promised, and content links directly to TikTok Shop or Zalo Mini App.

Outcome: Sustainable system where Al generates leads and KOCs convert them.

**US VS. THEM SECTION (Why Digicon approach?)**

**THE OLD WAY | SIGNAL-FIRST APPROACH**

1\. Contact KOCs, get ghosted or rejected | 1\. Build visual authority first with AI

2\. Pay $20k+ booking fees upfront (fixed cost) | 2\. Deploy 30-50 high-quality video variants/ month at 10% of the cost

3\. Post content, pray it converts | 3\. Mine verified buying signals from real engagement

4\. Gain only vanity metrics and pure guesswork | 4\. Approach KOC with proof of demand

5\. Hire more KOCs until something clicks | 5\. Negotiate commission-only deals (aligned incentives)

6\. Repeat with no learning and leverage | 6\. Stack validated learnings, KOCs verify, both win

**HONESTY BOX (What’s the catch? Can I actually trust them?)**

What We Promise

\- Proven AI product visualization format that generates views and passes the legitimacy test

\- **Captured** buying signals from real audience engagement

\- Negotiation leverage to shift from booking fees to commission deals

\- 2026-compliant documentation KOCs legally require

What We Don’t Promise

\- Guaranteed revenue numbers (as we deliver visibility and leverage)

\- KOCs will definitely say yes (we give you the best possible position, you still pitch)

\- Overnight results (this is a system, not a hack)

**FINAL CTA / CLOSING SECTION**

Stop Chasing KOCs. Start Attracting Them.

**In 3 months, your brands go**

From | To

“We are guessing what works” | “We have intent data showing real buying signals, plus validated creative patterns that can be replicated”

“Our customer data is stale” | “We know what they’re asking, objecting, wanting right now”

“KOCs ghost us” | “KOCs see us as a good deal”

Gambling on attention each campaign | Building a repeatable, proven growth system

Paying $20,000 booking fees | Offering commission-only partnerships

If you want influencer posts, hire an agency. If you want an AI-enabled brand acceleration system that makes quality KOCs want to work with you on commission, let's talk.
